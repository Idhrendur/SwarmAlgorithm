# SwarmAlgorithm
When I was in college it wasn't well known that you could train your neural nets on a graphics card for cheap. So there was all kinds of research into clever ways to accomplish the training. This was my attempt at a 'swarm algorithm', supposedly more advanced than what the grad students were doing. We've made some major advances since then.
